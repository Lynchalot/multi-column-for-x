# Changelog

## 0.7.0
- Top bar redesigned: tabs and controls on one line (wrapping on small windows), the All / Tweets / Retweets… views on a sub-line;
  a view only appears once the feed has something for it (no empty Replies tab).
- Columns on/off + retry is now a permanent pill in X's left sidebar (it used to float over the chat button).
- Posts and profiles open in a new tab by default (setting), so you never lose your place; "this tab" mode returns you to the exact spot.
- Image viewer gained Download and Copy link buttons.
- Download location: default `X` folder inside Downloads; "Ask me where to save" for anywhere else; aria2 accepts a full path.
- New settings category: **Algorithmic content** (For you tab, only followed accounts, Who to follow, Trending, Topics, Discover more, Premium upsells).
- Translate post (uses X's own "Translate post"), Explore pages in columns (best effort), columns follow window resizes,
  no flash when loading comments, comment order menu is readable.

## 0.6.x
- Fixed "Loading more… waiting for X" (a scroll lock froze X's page); faster loading; Copy diagnostics.
- Comment ordering and writing a comment from the comments panel; flat downloads with a `-twitter` source tag.

## 0.5.x
- Reads X's own timeline data instead of copying its page: no flicker, in-card video, filters, NSFW toggle, sidebar controls,
  Control Panel for Twitter and Media Harvest features built in.
